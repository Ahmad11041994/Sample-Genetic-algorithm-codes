/*This code implements a genetic algorithm to solve the following LPP:
Maximize Z=4x1+3x2
subject to 
         2x1+x2<=1000
         x1+x2<=800
         x1<=400,x2<=700
         x1,x2>=0
The global optimal solution to this problem is x1=200,x2=600, Max Z=2600. 
This code can be easily executed on any IDE or online GDB without the need of any input.*/
